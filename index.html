                <h2>ASHOK DHUNGANA</h2>
                <p>My name is Ashok Dhungana, and I am a fourth-year student at Herald College pursuing my BIT Hons
                    degree in the first semester. As someone with a varied mix of abilities and interests, I consider
                    this to be one of my best assets. I've been attracted by technology and programming since I was a
                    child, which drove me to pursue training in MERN (Full Stack Development), a stack of technologies
                    used to construct web applications. I am a true artist at heart, with a strong desire to paint.I am
                    a multilingual individual with a passion for motorcycles and a background in software development. I
                    have several years of experience riding motorcycles, and I am fluent in English, Nepali, Hindi, and
                    German. I am a person who is passionate about many things, and I believe that my diverse set of
                    skills and interests will be an asset as I pursue my goals and aspirations. I recently completed a
                    3.5-year stay in Germany, where I gained proficiency in the German language and culture. My greatest
                    achievements include my MERN training and my time spent in Germany. My current goals include
                    finishing my BIT Hons degree with good grades and pursuing a career as a software developer at a
                    multinational company. Ultimately, I hope to start my own IT business and write a novel. I am always
                    looking for new opportunities to learn and grow and am confident in my ability to achieve great
                    things in the future.My first goal is to finish my BIT Hons degree with good grades. Once I have
                    completed my degree, I plan to pursue a career as a software developer at a multinational company to
                    gain experience. After working for a multinational company, I hope to start my own business in the
                    IT field, and eventually, I would like to write a novel. Currently, I am working on writing short
                    stories and hope to one day publish a novel.Another passion of mine is driving. I love to ride
                    motorcycles and I have been riding for several years now. However, when it comes to cars, I would
                    not consider myself a professional driver, as I do not have as much experience driving them.

                    In conclusion, I am a person who is passionate about many things and I believe that my diverse set
                    of skills and interests will be an asset as I pursue my goals and aspirations. I am always looking
                    for new opportunities to learn and grow, and I am confident that I will continue to achieve great
                    things in the future.
